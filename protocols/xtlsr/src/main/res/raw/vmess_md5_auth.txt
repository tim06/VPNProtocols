This configuration (VMess MD5 authentication) has been deprecated by upstream because of its questionable resistance to tampering and concealment.

As of January 1, 2022, compatibility with MD5 authentication information will be disabled on the server side by default. Any client using MD5 authentication information will not be able to connect to a server with VMess MD5 authentication information disabled.
